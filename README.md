This project was a recreation of a local company's website, built in ReactJS for scalability. The original site can be found <a href="https://omicronaec.com/#">here.</a>I am in no way affiliated with the business and the project was for my own educational purposes. Only a home page is built so far, but it can be easily expanded to a multi-page website with the existing code structure.

I wanted to recreate a website as closely as I could to the original with all but a few features. The company bio and custom nav bar were two challenging elements. The company bio list involved taught me a lot about chaining CSS selectors and custom animations. It took some time to get the hover animations to look fluid and professional. The nav bar was also challening both in the sliding element and allowing the document to scroll underneath the nav when visible, while keeping the nav content centered on the screen.

In the future, I'd like to add a clickable element on the nav bar which scrolls the page and changes dynamically according to the location in the document. I'd also like to add more routes to expand the site.
